      <p>Hello! My name is Wayne Charrette. I am currently a student in the UNH Coding Bootcamp. I have been in the
        class for three weeks. I am attending this course for a few different reasons. Primarily, I can
        immediately apply
        lessons learned here to my day job, and second, I am interested in possibly pursuing new career options that I
        feel may be afforded to me with the experience I gain through this course. </p>
      <p>Currently, I work for the University of New Hampshire within the Undergraduate Admissions Office. My job title
        is "CRM Specialist." As part of my duties, I maintain our recruitment and application data in a CRM called
        Slate. Slate is a SQL based CRM, not entirely disimilar to other CRMs like Salesforce.</p>
      <p>I have two cats: a
        Siamese cat named Toffee and a
        black cat named Tonkatsu. I live in Dover, New Hampshire with my partner, Natalie.</p></p>
